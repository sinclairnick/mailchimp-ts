There's not much else to say, really.

### About

This is a very straightforward project which basically just packages the OpenAPI-generated typescript code, which means it's easy to keep up to date.

It uses the [openapi-typescript-codegen](https://github.com/ferdikoomen/openapi-typescript-codegen) npm package to generate the client, and then adds a thin wrapper to get the authentication and endpoint set up correctly.
